# Climate Toolbox

Hi! //
My name is Maria Chara Karypidou and I am a PhD candidate in Climatology. //
I am located at the Department of Meteorology and Climatology, at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in Greece. //
This tiny dot of the internet is my attempt to communicate bits of code with some functionality in climate sciences. //
