# Climate Toolbox

Hi!\
My name is Maria Chara Karypidou and I am a PhD candidate in Climatology.\
I am located at the Department of Meteorology and Climatology, at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in Greece.\
This tiny dot of the internet is my attempt to communicate bits of code with some functionality in climate sciences.\
