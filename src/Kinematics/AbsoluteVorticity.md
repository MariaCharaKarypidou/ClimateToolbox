# Absolute Vorticity

As discussed in the <a href="https://mariacharakarypidou.github.io/ClimateToolbox/Kinematics/RelativeVorticity.html"> previous section, </a> the localised spin of an air mass is described by a quantity termed "Relative Vorticity". However, as the earth rotates, it is also having an impact on the motion of air masses.
