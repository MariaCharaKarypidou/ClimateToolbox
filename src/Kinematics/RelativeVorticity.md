# Relative Vorticity

In a way, wind is in a continuous dance mode around the globe. Nonetheless, it is also performing a local dance, spinning around itself. In dynamic meteorology, this movement of the wind is described by a quantity termed as "relative vorticity". Briefly, relative vorticity is a measure of the spin of an air mass.

## Theory

Theory is taken from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Dynamic-Meteorology-International-Geophysics/dp/0123848660"> "An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology" </a> by James R. Holton and Gregory J. Hakim.\

According to them, "Vorticity, the microscopic measure of rotation in a fluid, is a vector field defined as the curl of velocity. The absolute vorticity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large \omega_\alpha"> is the curl of the absolute velocity, whereas the relative vorticity <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\large \omega"> is the curl of the relative velocity:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \omega_\alpha \equiv \nabla\times \U_\alpha">

which in Cartesian coordinates is analyzed to the following:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \omega = (\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial z}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y})">

After performing scale analysis on the above equation, it appears that the horizontal components are negligible, and therefore only the vertical component is used, leading to the following equation for relative vorticity:

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \zeta = \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}"> 



## Code
This tutorial is based on the <a href="https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/index.html#"> MetPy </a> Python library and exploits the <a href="https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/api/generated/metpy.calc.vorticity.html?highlight=vorticity#metpy.calc.vorticity"> vorticity </a> function. \
Before using the <a href="https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/api/generated/metpy.calc.vorticity.html?highlight=vorticity#metpy.calc.vorticity"> vorticity </a> function, let's take a look at the code. <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy"> MetPy's repository </a> is openly accesible in Github, making our lives easier. If we move to the source code of the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/main/src/metpy/calc/kinematics.py"> Kinematics </a> directory and look within lines 26-67, we will have a closer look of what happens within the function. 


```
def vorticity(u, v, *, dx=None, dy=None, x_dim=-1, y_dim=-2):
    r"""Calculate the vertical vorticity of the horizontal wind.

```
As we see, the <a href="https://unidata.github.io/MetPy/latest/api/generated/metpy.calc.vorticity.html?highlight=vorticity#metpy.calc.vorticity"> vorticity </a> function requires the U and V wind components as input. In addition, some information about the dx and dy is required, referring to the grid spacing on the Y and the x-axis.

```
dudy = first_derivative(u, delta=dy, axis=y_dim)
dvdx = first_derivative(v, delta=dx, axis=x_dim)
return dvdx - dudy
```

The key information is provided in lines 65-57. As we see, finite differences are calculated using the <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/9b01cbef28927a8fc70984807166b6f151f6990d/src/metpy/calc/tools.py#L952"> first_derivative </a> function. The <a href="https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/9b01cbef28927a8fc70984807166b6f151f6990d/src/metpy/calc/tools.py#L952"> first_derivative </a> function uses forward and backward differencing at the edges of the domain and central differences at every other part of the domain. We are reminded that in first order finite differencing, the following formulas are applied:

1. The one-sided (forward) difference: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \frac{f(a \dotplus h)-f(a)}{h}"> 

2. The one-sided (backward) difference: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \frac{f(a)-f(a-h)}{h}"> 

3. The central difference: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \frac{f(a \dotplus h)-f(a-h)}{2h}"> 

The partial derivatives are then subtracted using the formula: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}"> 


## Hands-on

For this exercise we use the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, downloaded from the <a href="https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home"> Copernicus Climate Data Store.  </a> The region of interest is southern Africa and extends between latitudes from -10 to -35 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE $^{\circ}$">S and between longitudes from 10 to 42 <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\LARGE $^{\circ}$">E.
